# 1 Creating a First Java Class

```java
public class MyFirstClass {

}
```

&emsp;&emsp;The name of this Java class is `MyFirstClass`. We need to save this text in a file named `MyFirstClass.java`. 

> A `public` Java class must be saved in a file that has the same name as the class with the extension `.java`. This is mandatory and is in fact very convenient because we do not need to open a file to know what class is written in it.
